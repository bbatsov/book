<h1>The OCaml Platform</h1>
<p>So far in the book, we’ve gone through a number of techniques you can
use to build real OCaml programs. We’ll now wrap up this part by
examining the tools you can use for editing, compiling, testing,
documenting and publishing your own projects.</p>
<p>The OCaml community has developed a platform of modern tools to
interface it with IDEs such as Visual Studio Code. All you need to do is
to specify your project metadata (for example, library dependencies and
compiler versions), and the OCaml Platform tools can generate API
documentation and also implement adopt modern software engineering
practises such as continuous integration (CI) and unit or fuzz
testing.</p>
<section class="level2" id="a-hello-world-ocaml-project">
<h2>A Hello World OCaml Project</h2>
<p>Let’s start by creating a sample OCaml project and navigating around
it. Dune has a basic built-in command to initialize a project template
that is suitable to get us started.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre data-filter-output=">" data-host="lama" data-user="fun" class="command-line"><code class="language-bash">dune init proj hello
&gt;Success: initialized project component named hello
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Dune will create a <code>hello/</code> directory and populate it with
a skeleton OCaml project. This sample project has the basic metadata
required for us to learn more about the opam package manager and the
dune build tool that we’ve used earlier in the book.</p>
<p>At this point, we need to use opam to setup our development
environment. You’ve almost certainly done this already at this point in
the book, but in case you’ve skipped straight to this chapter we will
first initialise opam’s global state.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">$ opam init</code></pre>
</div>
<p>By default, opam doesn’t require any special user permissions and
stores all of the files it installs in <code>~/.opam</code> (such as the
current build of the OCaml compiler if you didn’t have one pre-installed
when you initialised opam). You can run <code>opam switch</code> to see
all the different sandboxed environments you have available, and
<code>opam switch create</code> will let you construct new ones.</p>
<p>It is also possible to create a “local switch” that stores all the
dependencies within the current project working directory. Let’s do this
for our hello world project next:</p>

<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">$ cd hello
$ opam switch create .</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This will invoke opam to install the project dependencies (in this
case, just dune as we didn’t specify any more when initialising the
project). All of the files from a local switch will be present under
<code>_opam/</code> in the working directory. You can use
<code>opam env</code> to add the right directories to your local shell
path so that you can invoke locally installed tools:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">$ eval $(opam env)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>If you prefer not to modify your shell configuration, then you can
also invoke commands via <code>opam exec</code> to modify the path for
the subcommand specified in the remainder of the command line.</p>
<section data-type="note" class="level5" id="choosing-an-ocaml-compiler-version">
<h5>Choosing an OCaml compiler version</h5>

<p>When you want to select a particular version of the OCaml compiler,
you can use <code>opam switch list-available</code> to get a set of
versions. You’ll notice that there are three different types of OCaml
compiler packages.</p>

<p><code>ocaml-system</code> detects a pre-existing version of the OCaml
compiler on your machine, and installs a wrapper package of that
particular version. This is a fast operation since nothing needs to be
compiled. The only thing you need to do to create a system switch is to
have the right version of OCaml already installed (e.g.&nbsp;via
<code>apt</code> or Homebrew) and to pass the same version to the switch
creation as an additional argument. For example, if you have OCaml
4.13.1 installed:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">$ opam switch create . 4.13.1</code></pre>
</div>

<p><code>ocaml-base-compiler</code> builds a switch-local copy of that
OCaml version from scratch. It can take a little longer than
<code>ocaml-system</code>, but you have much more flexibility about the
choice of versions. The default operation of
<code>opam switch create</code> is to calculate the latest supported
compiler version from your project metadata and use that one for the
local switch.</p>

<p><code>ocaml-variants</code> is used when you need to add custom
configuration options to the compiler, such as <code>flambda</code>. In
this case, you can also install <code>ocaml-options-*</code> packages
alongside <code>ocaml-variants</code> to activate those configuration
flags. For example, if you wanted to use the <code>flambda</code>
inliner with your package, you would:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre data-filter-output=">" data-host="lama" data-user="fun" class="command-line"><code class="language-bash">opam switch create . ocaml-variants.4.13.1+options ocaml-option-flambda
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>You can see the full set of option packages by using:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre data-filter-output=">" data-host="lama" data-user="fun" class="command-line"><code class="language-bash">opam search ocaml-option
</code></pre>
</div>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="structure-of-an-ocaml-project">
<h3>Structure of an OCaml project</h3>
<p>Back in <a data-type="xref" href="files-modules-and-programs.html#files-modules-and-programs">Chapter 4, Files Modules And Programs</a>, we looked at what a
simple program with a couple of OCaml modules looks like. Let’s now look
at the set of files in our <code>hello/</code> application to examine a
fuller project structure.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">├── dune-project
├── hello.opam
├── lib
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── dune
├── bin
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── dune
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── main.ml
└── test
    ├── dune
    └── hello.ml</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Some observations about this structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code>dune-project</code> file marks the root of the project,
and is used for writing down some key metadata for the project (more on
that later).</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>hello.opam</code> file contains metadata for
registering this software as an opam project. As we’ll see, we won’t
need to edit this manually because we can generate the file via
<code>dune</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>There are three source directories, each with its own
<code>dune</code> file specifying the build parameters for that part of
the codebase. The trio of <code>lib</code>, <code>bin</code> and
<code>test</code> makes good sense for a project that is primarily an
executable, rather than a reusable library. In that case, you would
generally use these libraries as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>lib</code> directory would contain the bulk of the
source.</li>
<li>The <code>bin</code> directory would contain a thin wrapper on top
of the code in <code>lib</code> which actually launches the
executable.</li>
<li>The <code>test</code> directory has the bulk of the tests for
<code>lib</code>, which, following the advice in <a data-type="xref" href="testing.html#where-should-tests-go">Chapter 17, Testing</a>,
are in a separate directory from the source.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Now we’ll talk about the different parts of this structure in more
detail.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="defining-module-names">
<h3>Defining module names</h3>
<p>Individual <code>ml</code> and <code>mli</code> files each define
OCaml modules, named after the file and capitalised. Modules names are
the only name you refer to within OCaml code.</p>
<p>Let’s create a <code>Msg</code> module in our skeleton project inside
<code>lib/</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">$ echo 'let greeting = "Hello World"' &gt; lib/msg.ml
$ echo 'val greeting : string' &gt; lib/msg.mli</code></pre>
</div>
<p>A valid OCaml module name cannot contain dashes or other special
characters other than underscores.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="defining-libraries-as-collections-of-modules">
<h3>Defining libraries as collections of modules</h3>
<p>One or more OCaml modules can be gathered together into a
<em>library</em>, providing a convenient way to package up multiple
dependencies with a single name. A project usually puts the business
logic of the application into a library rather than directly into an
executable binary, since this makes writing tests and documentation
easier in addition to improving reusability. <a data-secondary="defining libraries" data-primary="libraries" data-type="indexterm">&nbsp;</a> Let’s look at
<code>lib/dune</code> in more detail:</p>




<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">(library
 (inline_tests)
 (name hello)
 (preprocess
  (pps ppx_inline_test)))</code></pre>
</div>
<p>By default, dune exposes libraries as <em>wrapped</em> under a single
module, and the <code>name</code> field determines the name of that
module. In our example project <code>msg.ml</code> is defined in
<code>lib/dune</code> which defines a <code>hello</code> library. Thus,
users of our newly defined module can access it as
<code>Hello.Msg</code>. You can read more about wrapping and module
aliases in <a data-type="xref" href="compiler-frontend.html#wrapping-libraries-with-module-aliases">Chapter 25, The Compiler Frontend Parsing And Type
Checking</a>.</p>
<p>Although our example library only currently contains a single
<code>Msg</code> module, it is common to have multiple modules per
library. Other modules within the <code>hello</code> library can simply
refer to <code>Msg</code>. You must refer to library names in a
<code>dune</code> file when deciding what libraries to link in, and
never individual module names. You can query the installed libraries in
your current switch via <code>ocamlfind list</code> at your command
prompt, after running <code>opam install ocamlfind</code> to install it
if necessary.</p>
<p>If there’s a <code>public_name</code> field present in the
<code>dune</code> library definition, this determines the publically
exposed name for the library, which is what you use via the
<code>libraries</code> field in the dune file. Without a public name,
the defined library is local to the current dune project only. The
<code>(libraries)</code> field in the <code>lib/dune</code> file is
empty since this is a trivial standalone library.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="writing-test-cases-for-a-library">
<h3>Writing test cases for a library</h3>
<p>Our next step is to define a test case in <code>test/dune</code> for
our library. We can define inline tests within our library as we did
earlier in <a data-type="xref" href="testing.html#testing">Chapter 17, Testing</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">open Base

let greeting = "Hello World"

let%test "size" =
  String.length greeting = 11</code></pre>
</div>
<p>We can also define more elaborate executable tests inside the
<code>test/</code> directory as well. The <code>(test)</code> dune field
builds an executable binary that is run when you invoke
<code>dune runtest</code> (along with any inline tests defined within
libraries). In our project, the <code>test/hello.ml</code> module
defines the executable test cases. We’ll also add a dependency on our
locally defined <code>hello</code> library so that we can access it.</p>

<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(test
 (name hello)
 (libraries hello))</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Once you run the tests via <code>dune runtest</code>, you can find
the built artefacts in <code>_build/default/test/</code> in your project
checkout.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="building-an-executable-program">
<h3>Building an executable program</h3>
<p>Finally, we want to actually use our hello world from the
command-line. This is defined in <code>bin/dune</code> in a very similar
fashion to test cases.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(executable
 (public_name hello)
 (name main)
 (libraries hello)))</code></pre>
</div>
<p>There has to be a <code>bin/hello.ml</code> alongside the
<code>bin/dune</code> file that represents the entry module for the
executable. Only that module and the modules and libraries it depends on
will be linked into the executable. Much like libraries, the
<code>(name)</code> field here has to adhere to OCaml module naming
conventions, and the <code>public_name</code> field represents the
binary name that is installed onto the system and just needs to be a
valid Unix or Windows filename.</p>
<p>Now try modifying <code>bin/main.ml</code> to refer to our
<code>Hello.Msg</code> module:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">let () = print_endline Hello.Msg.greeting</code></pre>
</div>
<p>You can build and execute the command locally using
<code>dune exec</code> and the local name of the executable. You can
also find the built executable in
<code>_build/default/bin/main.exe</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre data-filter-output=">" data-host="lama" data-user="fun" class="command-line"><code class="language-bash">dune build
dune exec -- bin/main.exe
&gt;Hello World
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>You can also refer to the public name of the executable if its more
convenient.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre data-filter-output=">" data-host="lama" data-user="fun" class="command-line"><code class="language-bash">dune exec -- hello
&gt;Hello World
</code></pre>
</div>
</section>

<section class="level2" id="setting-up-an-integrated-development-environment">
<h2>Setting up an integrated development environment</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve seen the basic structure of the OCaml project, it’s
time to setup an integrated development environment. An IDE is
particularly useful for use with OCaml due to the extra information you
gain from the static type information present in the codebase. A good
IDE will provide you with the facilities to browse interface
documentation, see inferred types for code, and to jump to the
definitions of external modules.</p>
<section class="level3" id="using-visual-studio-code">
<h3>Using Visual Studio Code</h3>
<p>The recommended IDE for newcomers to OCaml is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a> using the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ocamllabs.ocaml-platform">OCaml
Platform plugin</a>. The plugin uses the Language Server Protocol to
communicate with your opam and dune environment. All you need to do is
to install the OCaml LSP server via opam:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">opam install ocaml-lsp-server</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Once installed, the VSCode OCaml plugin will ask you which opam
switch to use. Just the default one should be sufficient get you going
with building and browsing your interfaces.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="browsing-interface-documentation">
<h3>Browsing interface documentation</h3>
<p>The OCaml LSP server understands how to interface with dune and
examine the build artifacts (such as the typed <code>.cmt</code>
interface files), so opening your local project in VS Code is sufficient
to activate all the features. Try navigating over to
<code>bin/main.ml</code>, where you will see the invocation to the
<code>hello</code> library.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">let () = print_endline Hello.Msg.greeting</code></pre>
</div>
<p>First perform a build of the project to generate the type annotation
files. Then hover your mouse over the <code>Hello.Msg.greeting</code>
function – you should see some documentation pop up about the function
and its arguments. This information comes from the <em>docstrings</em>
written into the <code>msg.mli</code> interface file in the
<code>hello</code> library.</p>
<p>Modify the <code>msg.mli</code> interface file to contain some
signature documentation as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">(** This is a docstring, as it starts with "(**", as opposed to normal comments
    that start with a single star.

    The top-most docstring of the module should contain a description of the
    module, what it does, how to use it, etc.

    The function-specific documentation located below the function signatures. *)

val greeting : string

(** This is the docstring for the [greeting] function.

    A typical documentation for this function would be:

    Returns a greeting message.

    {4 Examples}

    {[ print_endline greeting ]} *)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Documentation strings are parsed by the <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/odoc">odoc</a> tool to generate HTML and
PDF documentation from a collection of opam packages. If you intend your
code to be used by anyone else (or indeed, by yourself a few months
later) you should take the time to annotate your OCaml signature files
with documentation. An easy way to preview the HTML documentation is to
build it locally with dune:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-skip">$ opam install odoc
$ dune build @doc</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This will leave the HTML files in
<code>_build/default/_doc/_html</code>, which you can view normally with
a webbrowser.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="autoformatting-your-source-code">
<h3>Autoformatting your source code</h3>
<p>As you develop more OCaml code, you’ll find it convenient to have it
formatted to a common style. The <code>ocamlformat</code> tool can help
you do this easily from within VSCode.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-skip">$ echo 'version=0.20.1' &gt; .ocamlformat
$ opam install ocamlformat.0.20.1</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>.ocamlformat</code> file controls the autoformatting
options available, and fixes the version of the tool that is used. You
can upgrade to a newer ocamlformat version whenever you want, but it is
a manual process to avoid an upstream release auto-reformatting your
project code without your intervention. You can examine the formatting
options via <code>ocamlformat --help</code> – most of the time the
defaults should be fine.</p>
<p>Once you’ve got ocamlformat configured, you can either format your
project from within VSCode (<code>shift-alt-F</code> being the default),
or by running:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-skip">$ dune build @fmt</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This will generate a set of reformatted files in the build directory,
which you can accept with <code>dune promote</code> as you did earlier
in the testing chapter.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="publishing-your-code-online">
<h2>Publishing your code online</h2>
<p>With your IDE all set up you’ll quickly develop useful OCaml code and
want to share it with others. We’ll now go through how to define opam
packages, set up continuous integration and publish your code.</p>
<section class="level3" id="defining-opam-packages">
<h3>Defining opam packages</h3>
<p>The only metadata file that is really <em>required</em> to
participate in the open-source OCaml ecosystem is an <code>opam</code>
file in your source tree. Each <code>opam</code> file defines a
<em>package</em> – a collection of OCaml libraries and executable
binaries or application data. Each opam package can define dependencies
on other opam packages, and includes build and testing directions for
your project. This is what’s installed when you eventually publish the
package and someone else types in <code>opam install hello</code>.</p>
<p>A collection of <code>opam</code> files can be stored in an <em>opam
repository</em> to create a package database, with a central one for the
OCaml ecosystem available at <a class="uri" href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository">https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository</a>. The official
(but not exclusive) tool used for manipulating <code>opam</code> files
is the eponymous <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org">opam package
manager</a> that we’ve been using throughout this book.</p>
<section data-type="note" class="level5" id="how-do-we-name-ocaml-modules-libraries-and-packages">
<h5>How do we name OCaml modules, libraries and packages?</h5>
<p>Much of the time, the module, library, and package names are all the
same. The same name can often be used for the library and the package.
But there are reasons for these names to be distinct as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some libraries are exposed as multiple top-level modules, which
means you need to pick a different name for referring to that collection
of modules.</li>
<li>Even when the library has a single top-level module, you might want
the library name to be different from the module name to avoid name
clashes at the library level.</li>
<li>Package names might differ from library names if a package combines
multiple libraries and/or binaries together.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to understand the difference between modules,
libraries and packages as you work on bigger projects. These can easily
have thousands of modules, hundreds of libraries and dozens of opam
packages in a single codebase.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="generating-project-metadata-from-dune">
<h3>Generating project metadata from dune</h3>
<p>The <code>hello.opam</code> file in our sample project is currently
empty, but you don’t need to write it by hand – instead, we can define
our project metadata using the dune build system and have the opam file
autogenerated for us. The root directory of an OCaml project built by
dune has a <code>dune-project</code> file that defines the project
metadata. In our example project, it starts with:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(lang dune 2.9)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The line above is the version of the syntax used in your build files,
and <em>not</em> the actual version of the <code>dune</code> binary. One
of the nicest features of dune is that it is forwards-compatible with
older metadata. By defining the version of the dune language that you
are currently using, <em>future</em> versions of dune will do their best
to emulate the current behaviour until you chose to upgrade your
project.</p>
<p>The rest of the <code>dune-project</code> file defines other useful
project metadata:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(name hello)
(documentation "https://username.github.io/hello/")
(source (github username/hello))
(license ISC)
(authors "Your name")
(maintainers "Your name")
(generate_opam_files true)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The fields in here all represent project metadata ranging from
textual descriptions, to project URLs, to other opam package
dependencies. Go ahead and edit the metadata above to reflect your own
details, and then build the project:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-skip">$ dune build</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The build command will update the <code>hello.opam</code> file in
your source tree as well, keeping it in sync with your changes. The
final part of the <code>dune-project</code> file contains dependency
information for other packages your project depends on.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(package
 (name hello)
 (synopsis "A short description of the project")
 (description "A short description of the project")
 (depends
  (ocaml (&gt;= 4.08.0))
  (alcotest :with-test)
  (odoc :with-doc)))</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>(package)</code> stanza here refers to opam packages, both
for the name and for the dependency specifications. This is in contrast
to the <code>dune</code> files which refer to ocamlfind libraries, since
those represent the compilation units for OCaml code (whereas opam
packages are broader collections of package data).</p>
<p>Notice that the dependency specification can also include version
information. One of the key features of opam is that each repository
contains multiple versions of the same package. The opam CLI contains a
constraint solver that will find versions of all dependencies that are
compatible with your current project. When you add a dependency, you can
therefore specify lower and upper version bounds as required by your use
of that package. The <code>with-test</code> and <code>with-doc</code>
are further constraints that only add those dependencies for test and
documentation generation respectively.</p>
<p>Once you’ve defined your opam and dune dependencies, you can run
various lint commands to check that your metadata is consistent.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-skip">$ opam dune-lint
$ opam lint</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>opam-dune-lint</code> plugin will check that the ocamlfind
libraries and opam packages in your dune files match up, and offer to
fix them up if it spots a mismatch. <code>opam lint</code> runs
additional checks on the opam files within your project.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="setting-up-continuous-integration">
<h3>Setting up Continuous Integration</h3>
<p>Once you have your project metadata defined, it’s a good time to
begin hosting it online. Two of the most popular platforms for this are
<a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com">GitLab</a>. The remainder of this chapter will
assume you are using GitHub for simplicity, although you are encouraged
to check out the alternatives to find the best solution for your own
needs.</p>
<p>When you create a GitHub repository and push your code to it, you can
also add an OCaml GitHub Action that will install the OCaml Platform
tools and run your code across various architectures and operating
systems. You can find the full documentation online at the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/set-up-ocaml">GitHub Setup
OCaml</a> marketplace. Configuring an action is as simple as adding a
<code>.github/workflows/test.yml</code> file to your project that looks
something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-yaml">name: Hello world workflow
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
jobs:
  build:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os:
          - macos-latest
          - ubuntu-latest
          - windows-latest
        ocaml-compiler:
          - 4.13.x
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use OCaml ${{ matrix.ocaml-compiler }}
        uses: ocaml/setup-ocaml@v2
        with:
          ocaml-compiler: ${{ matrix.ocaml-compiler }}
      - run: opam install . --deps-only --with-test
      - run: opam exec -- dune build
      - run: opam exec -- dune runtest</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This workflow file will run your project on OCaml installations on
Windows, macOS and Linux, using the latest patch release of OCaml 4.13.
Notice that it also runs the test cases you have defined earlier on all
those different operating systems as well. You can do an awful lot of
customisation of these continuous integration workflows, so refer to the
online documentation for more options.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="other-conventions">
<h3>Other conventions</h3>
<p>There are a few other files you may also want to add to a project to
match common conventions:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <code>Makefile</code> contains targets for common actions such as
<code>all</code>, <code>build</code>, <code>test</code> or
<code>clean</code>. While you don’t need this when using VSCode, some
other operating system package managers might benefit from having one
present.</li>
<li>the <code>LICENSE</code> defines the terms under which your code is
made available. Our example defaults to the permissive ISC license, and
this is generally a safe default unless you have specific plans for your
project.</li>
<li>a <code>README.md</code> is a Markdown-formatted introduction to
your library or application.</li>
<li>a <code>.gitignore</code> file contains the patterns for generated
files from the OCaml tools so that they can be ignored by the Git
version control software. If you’re not familiar with using Git, look
over one of the tutorials one such as GitHub’s <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">git hello
world</a>.</li>

<section class="level3" id="releasing-your-code-into-the-opam-repository">
<h3>Releasing your code into the opam repository</h3>
<p>Once your continuous integration is passing, you are all set to try
to tag a release of your project and share it with other users! The
OCaml Platform supplies a convenient tool called
<code>dune-release</code> which automates much of this process for
you.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-skip">$ opam install dune-release</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The first thing you need to do is to create a <code>CHANGES.md</code>
file in your project in Markdown format, which contains a header per
version. This is typically a succinct summary of the changes between
versions that can be read by users. For our first release, we might
have:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">## v1.0.0

- Initial public release of our glorious hello world
  project (@avsm)
- Added test cases for making sure we do in fact hello world.</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Commit this file to your repository in the root. Before you proceed
with a release, you need to make sure that all of your local changes
have been pushed to the remote GitHub repository, and that your working
tree is clean. You can do this by using git:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">$ git clean -dxf
$ git diff</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This will remove any untracked files from the local checkout (such as
the <code>_build</code> directory) and check that tracked files are
unmodified. We should now be ready to perform the release! First create
a git tag to mark this release:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-skip">$ dune-release tag</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This will parse your <code>CHANGES.md</code> file and figure out the
latest version, and create a local git tag in your repository after
prompting you. Once that succeeds, you can start the release process
via:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-skip">$ dune-release</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This will begin an interactive session where you will need to enter
some GitHub authentication details (via creating a personal access
token). Once that is completed, the tool will run all local tests,
generate documentation and upload it to your GitHub pages branch for
that project, and finally offer to open a pull request to the central
opam-repository. Recall that the central opam package set is all just a
normal git repository, and so your opam file will be added to that and
your GitHub account will create a PR.</p>
<p>At this point, you can sit back and relax while the central opam
repository test system runs your package through a battery of
installations (including on exotic architectures you might not access
to, such as S390X mainframes or 32-bit ARMv7). If there is a problem
detected, some friendly maintainers from the OCaml community will
comment on the pull request and guide you through how to address it. You
can simply delete the git tag and re-run the release process until the
package is merged. Once it is merged, you can navigate to the
&lt;ocaml.org&gt; site and view it online in an hour or so. It will also
be available in the central repository for other users to install.</p>
<section data-type="note" class="level5" id="creating-lock-files-for-your-projects">
<h5>Creating lock files for your projects</h5>
<p>Before you publish a project, you might also want to create an opam
lock file to include with the archive. A lock file records the exact
versions of all the transitive opam dependencies at the time you
generate it. All you need to do is to run:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre data-filter-output=">" data-host="lama" data-user="fun" class="command-line"><code class="language-bash">opam lock
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This generates a <code>pkgname.opam.locked</code> file which contains
the same metadata as your original file, but with all the dependencies
explictly listed. Later on, if a user wants to reconstruct your exact
opam environment (as opposed to the package solution they might
calculate with a future opam repository), then they can pass an option
during installation:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre data-filter-output=">" data-host="lama" data-user="fun" class="command-line"><code class="language-bash">opam install pkgname --locked
opam switch create . --locked
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Lock files are an optional but useful step to take when releasing
your project to the Internet.</p>

<h2>Learning more from real projects</h2>
<p>There’s a lot more customisation that happens in any real project,
and we can’t cover every aspect in this book. The best way by far to
learn more is to dive in and compile an already established project, and
perhaps even contribute to it. There are thousands of libraries and
executable projects released on the opam repository which you can find
online at <a class="uri" href="https://ocaml.org">https://ocaml.org</a>.</p>
<p>A selection of some include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>patdiff</code> is an OCaml implementation of the patience diff
algorithm, and is a nice self-contained CLI project using Core. <a class="uri" href="https://github.com/janestreet/patdiff">https://github.com/janestreet/patdiff</a></li>
<li>The source code to this book is published as a self-contained
monorepo with all the dependencies bundled together, for convenient
compilation. <a class="uri" href="https://github.com/realworldocaml/book">https://github.com/realworldocaml/book</a></li>
<li>Flow is a static typechecker for JavaScript written in OCaml that
uses Base and works on macOS, Windows and Linux. It’s a good example of
a large, cross-platform CLI-driven tool. <a class="uri" href="https://github.com/facebook/flow">https://github.com/facebook/flow</a></li>
<li>Octez is an OCaml implementation of a proof-of-stake blockchain
called Tezos, which contains a <a href="https://tezos.gitlab.io/shell/the_big_picture.html#packages">comprehensive
collection</a> of libraries that such as interpreters for a stack
language, and a shell that uses Lwt to provide networking, storage and
cryptographic communications to the outside world. <a class="uri" href="https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos">https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos</a></li>
<li>MirageOS is a library operating system written in OCaml, that can
compile code to a variety of embedded and hypervisor targets. There are
100s of libraries all written using dune in a variety of ways available
at <a class="uri" href="https://github.com/mirage">https://github.com/mirage</a>.</li>
<li>You can find a number of standalone OCaml libraries for unicode,
parsing and computer graphics and OS interaction over at <a class="uri" href="https://erratique.ch/software">https://erratique.ch/software</a>.</li>
